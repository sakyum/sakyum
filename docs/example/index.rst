This tutorial will be a continuation of the `quick start <https://sakyum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html>`_. As we see in the `quick start` we create a project called **Schoolsite** and an app inside the project called **exam**. Taking from there let continue by creating models in our **exam** app.

**Note** that, you can write your views like the way you usually write them when using flask without sakyum. It work great, nothing change.
